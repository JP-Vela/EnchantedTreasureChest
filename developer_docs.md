Enchanted Treasure Chest is a kid's pirate themed treasure chest. It uses an electronic lock trigger by an RFID keycard. This project is built around an **Arduino** using the mfrc522 to read the card and control a servo locking, as well as a motorized opening mechanism.

# Arrrrrduino Packages

 - SPI.h (Serial Communication Library used to communicate with RFID module)
 - MFRC522.h (RFID Reader Library)
 - Servo.h (Servo Library)
