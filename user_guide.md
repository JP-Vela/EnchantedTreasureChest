Enchanted Treasure Chest is a kid's pirate themed treasure chest. It uses an electronic lock trigger by an RFID keycard. This project is built around an **Arduino** using the mfrc522 to read the card and control a servo locking, as well as a motorized opening mechanism.


# Software

 - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
 - Install MFRC522 Library inside the Arduino IDE

# Hardware


- Arduino Mega
- MFRC522 RFID Reader
- L9110S DC Motor Driver
- SG90 Micro Servo
- NORJIN 12v Linear Actuator
- 12v 1.5a Power Supply
- Male to male wires
- Male to female wires
- Breadboard

# Note About Circuit Diagram

  

- The above circuit diagram does not match the match the pins used in the code, but serves as a general visual of the hardware.

- If using Arduino UNO the SPI pins will be in a different place comared to the Arduino Mega. See [this diagram](https://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/arduino-spi-tutorial-uno-pins.png) for SPI pin location.

- Servo motor should be powered by the Arduinno 5v pin instead of the breadboard power rail.

- The breadboard power rail should be powered using the 12v power supply

- The Arduino should be powered by the breadboard power rail

# Next Steps

 - Run Main.ino script and place keycard near sensor to your key's ID
 - change the `lockID1` from `"C9F24FB3"` to whatever your key's ID is
